# js-hangman-2022
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Here, we are recreating it using vanilla JS and dialogs to create an interactive game.
